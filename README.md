Car Crash Analysis in the US (2022) -- Project Proposal

In this project we will take a look at fatal car crashes in the U.S. for the year 2022 using the following dataset https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/2022/

We want to answer: What times of day are these crashes most prevalent; which states and/or cities have a higher rates of fatal car crashes; how do environmental conditions (weather, lighting, visibility etc.) impact rates of fatal accidents in the US; as well as investigate any other correlations we may uncover through our analysis of the data. 

Potential visualizations: 
- An interactive map with a drop down menu that enables the user to select a major city to focus on, thus enabling them to see locations of car crashes. Additionally, the user could click on an accident pin and trigger popups that could provide additional information about the crash, such as the time of day and number of fatalities.
- An accident heatmap that visualizes areas with higher frequencies of car accidents
- Time-based Analysis: Line charts displaying accident trends over time
- A choropleth (on a national, state, or county level) to visualize and compare accident rates across different geographical locations. 
- More generally, an interactive dashboard that combines a combo of the above.
