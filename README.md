Car Crash Analysis in the US (2022)

In this project we will take a look at car crashes in the US for the year 2022  using the following dataset https://www.nhtsa.gov/file-downloads?p=nhtsa/downloads/FARS/2022/

We want to answer: What times of day are crashes most prevalent, which state has a higher rate of fatal car crashes, does weather impact fatal accidents in the US and other correlations we may find interesting. 

Potential visualizations:
-One visualization have interactive map to have drop down with major city to see car crashes or times of day for car crashes 
-Accident Heatmap: Areas with high accident frequency or heat map with number of fatalities
-Time-based Analysis: Line chart displaying accident trend over time
-Geographical Analysis: using choropleth to map visualize accident data state to state. 
-Interactive Dashboard that combines a combo of some of the above.
